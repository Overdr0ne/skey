;;; Commentary:

;; With this super key library, youâ€™ll be re-defining sty.el with
;; pow-erf.el skeys!

;;; Code:

(defun skey-define-keys (keymaps defs)
  (dolist (def defs)
    (let* ((cmd-keys (nth 0 def))
           (cmd-sym (nth 1 def))
           (cmd-keys (if (stringp cmd-keys)
                         (kbd cmd-keys)
                       cmd-keys)))
      (dolist (keymap keymaps)
        (define-key (symbol-value keymap) cmd-keys cmd-sym)))))

(provide 'skey)
;;; skey.el ends here
